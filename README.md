# Loan Management System

## Overview

The Loan Management System is a simple web application designed to handle basic loan management functions for a bank. This system allows users to:
- Lend money to customers.
- Make payments towards loans.
- View loan transaction ledgers.
- Get an overview of all loans and their statuses.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes the browser's local storage for data persistence.

## Features

1. **Lend Money**: Allows the bank to provide loans to customers with no restrictions on the amount or number of loans. Calculates the total amount to be paid and the monthly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment).

2. **Make Payment**: Customers can make payments towards their loans either as monthly EMIs or as lump sum amounts. Lump sum payments reduce the total loan amount and can decrease the number of remaining EMIs.

3. **View Ledger**: Allows customers to view all transactions associated with a specific loan ID. Displays balance amount, monthly EMI, and number of EMIs left.

4. **Account Overview**: Lists all loans taken by customers, showing details such as loan amount, total amount, EMI amount, total interest, amount paid to date, and the number of EMIs left.
